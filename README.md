# TDD Naan Factory Exercise

this exercise is going to bring together lots of concepts.

### Learning Outcomes
learning outcomes include:
- git
- github
- functions
- TDD
- seperation of concerns
- DRY CODE 
- DOD


## Installing and running
To run the naan factory do the following:

```python
import naan factory
run_factory()
```


### TDD - Test Driven Development

1. write the test
2. run it, and read the error
3. code and make it pass the test

this helps with:
- stop over engineering
- maintainable code
- reduce technical debt
- goes well with agile and working code
- errors can be your guide in complex systems

how it works is that we write unit tests.

#### Unit Tests

test single pieces of code. like a function

**base of test**
- usually has 3 phases
- setup phase (know variables)
- calling of function / piece of code with know variables
- asserting for expect output
